    <p>
      The choices we make on a daily basis - what we eat, how we commute, what we wear - contribute to the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change. Since the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide emissions in our atmosphere have increased consistently from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. This increase in carbon dioxide is affecting our climate in a dramatic way, both increasing our climate and the number of droughts and extreme weather events. We are all responsible for climate change and we all must be part of the solution.
